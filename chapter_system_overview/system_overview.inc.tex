% Explain the overall goals and loyout of the system

% Single "server"
%   - may be redundant servers running the same code and sharing one or more datastores and network services
%   - the server should expose an API and contain an eventing system
%   - use a plugin architecture to expand system
%     - all funtionality built as plugins
%     - plugins can depend on other plugins to expand funtionality
%     - plugins may contain an application component and an user interface component
%       - application component may or may not expose as a subset of the API
%       - application component may or may not connect to the event subsystem
%       - application component may or may not connect to the datastore subsystem
%     - Initial plugins:
%       - MQTT Core (MQTT connector to event subsystem)
%       - ?? Should the datastore subsystem use a plugin to connect to a real datastore?  What should be in the datastore?  Config? history? state?
%       - ?? Should historical data be stored via the datastore subsystem, a history/historical state subsystem, or a plugin directly?
%   - Will be written in Python3 initially.  May move to C++ if more performance is needed.
%   - Should be written as portable as possible.

% Network Services

% Sensors (really sensor framework)

% Other interfaces
