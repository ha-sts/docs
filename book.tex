\chapter{Preface}
This book is being written to plan, guide, and document the trials and
tribulations of designing and building home automation systems.  Throughout
this process, best practices and open standards will be followed as much as
possible.  Where there are no best practices or open standards, suggestions will
be documented in hopes of guiding others.

\chapter{Introduction}
% Will put as much as possible on OpenBSD for security.

%\section{Who am I?}

\section{What is to be accomplished here?}
% Building the systems component by component
% Small, inexpensive, non-invasive
% If possible, energy efficent
%   this will focus primarily on lighting

\section{Constraints and Considerations}
% SECURITY SECURITY SECURITY
% This is a home, make it as SECURE as possible
% OpenBSD if possible
% Review the man pages as they are THE documentation
% COTS to keep price down

\section{License and Disclaimers}
% Because it should be done
% Simplified BSD
% Any other "you're a dumbass" disclaimers

\chapter{Last Notes}
Don't copy and paste.  If you are implementing any of this, then it is most
likely your own home or place of work, and you will want to make sure you
understand the systems that you are working on.  Make sure you understand the
systems and procedures and make sure you only implement what you know you can
securely implement.  If you do it wrong, it's YOUR happy ass!
