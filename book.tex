%\chapter{Preface}
%This book is being written to plan, guide, and document the trials and tribulations of designing and building my home
%automation systems.  Throughout this process, best practices and open standards \sout{will be followed as much as
%possible} may or may not be paid any attention.  Where there are no best practices or open standards, \sout{suggestions
%will be documented in hopes of guiding others} I'll do whatever seems useful with a reasonable amount of work.

%\chapter{Last Notes}
%% Write something better for this section.
%Don't copy and paste.  If you are implementing any of this, then it is most
%likely your own home or place of work, and you will want to make sure you
%understand the systems that you are working on.  Make sure you understand the
%systems and procedures and make sure you only implement what you know you can
%securely implement.  If you do it wrong, it's YOUR happy ass!
